# Working with devcontainers

- You can cskldfsjdlkfj run devcontainer both locally and on the cloud with github codespaces.

## Running locally

### Requieriments (locally)

  1. Have the VScode [extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
  2. Have the docker deamon running with propper permissions (On both windows and linux the docker installation should have created a user group, so just add your user to it. For windows: "docker-users" on linux: "docker")
  3. (Only on windows): Set `git config --global core.autocrlf false`, this ensures that git doesn't reformat some script files to the windows line ending format. This leads to problems with parsing since windows uses the `\r` escape character instead of `\n`. You can fix this later manually by changing **CRLF** to **LF** in the right bottom corner of your VScode enviroment but that leads to wierd git issues.

### How to start

  1. Open the repository in VScode and click **"Reopen in container"** or use the [Command Pallete](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and select **Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container**
You can now use [localhost:80](http://localhost:80) for apache and [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for react
This process can take up to several minutes before everything compiles and runs
